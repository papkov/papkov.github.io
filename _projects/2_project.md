I have participated in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recursion-cellular-image-classification/overview">Recursion Cellular Image Classification</a> competition to learn PyTorch and apply my knowledge in microscopy imaging. Here is a description of my solution (29/866, silver) as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TC3JORV1BK2-nbYdOOGhsYUY2QKKnqml0BclitNcuro/edit?usp=sharing">slide deck</a> and a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recursion-cellular-image-classification/discussion/110393">blogpost</a>.
