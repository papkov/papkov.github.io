Hi, I'm a PhD student (aka Junior Research Fellow) at the Biomedical Computer Vision Lab, University of Tartu, supervised by <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/parts-leopold"> Leopold Parts</a>. 

Our team focuses on different aspects of health image analysis with neural networks. My academic interests include inverse problems (super-resolution, denoising, and deconvolution), self-supervised learning, and working with weak/incomplete annotations. 

Previously, I studied Medical Physics and developed algorithms for pediatric and neonatal ECG analysis. Most of my spare time in the last bachelor's year was spent at <a href="https://bioinf.me/en">Bioinformatics Institute</a>, and then I moved to Tartu for a master's (and then doctorate) degree in Computer Science. I have also interned at Google Research, developing an organ segmentation system for <a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/exploring-ai-radiotherapy-planning-mayo-clinic/">radiotherapy planning</a>. 

I enjoy travelling, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/54371989">sports</a>, and quizzing (both competitive — in <a href="https://rating.chgk.info/player/77673">Russian</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNf3rCP7yEM">English</a> — and on <a href="https://youtu.be/V_si8Ju--hc">TV</a>).
